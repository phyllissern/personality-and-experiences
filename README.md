Exploring the Interplay Between Personality Traits and Subjective Experiences: A Computational Approach

Abstract: In the kaleidoscope of human experience, individuals navigate the world through their own emotions, thoughts, and perceptions, which are shaped by the unique lens of their personality traits. Understanding the perception of subjective states is insightful in learning about the way individuals interpret and engage with the world around them. Building upon the findings of Webb et al. (2023), which suggest that GPT-3 exhibits a remarkable aptitude for abstract pattern induction, even surpassing human capabilities in most settings, the present study harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5. By simulating participants with different personalities, these models generate responses on how individuals experience various states. The results are cleaned, filtered, and analyzed, comparing the topology of phenomenological experience between different personalities. We hypothesize that an individual's personality traits significantly influence the way they perceive and feel about a given state and want to find the nature of these relations. These analyses extend the previous work of Lee et al. (2023), where a topological space of qualia was constructed, serving as a valuable proxy for quantifying experience in various dimensions.
